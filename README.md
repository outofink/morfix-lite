<h1 align="center">Morfix Lite</h1>

[Morfix Lite](https://morfix-lite.herokuapp.com) is an extremely lightweight front-end alternative for [Morfix](http://www.morfix.co.il/) using their API.

Powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/).

## Brief

[Morfix](http://www.morfix.co.il/) is an online dictionary service that
provides an in-depth translation from Hebrew to English, and vice versa. The
service's app has a particularly long loading time, and a complicated and
convoluted interface.

[Morfix Lite](https://morfix-lite.herokuapp.com) aims to provide the same
service, but with a completely new interface, which provides a search bar and
that's it.
